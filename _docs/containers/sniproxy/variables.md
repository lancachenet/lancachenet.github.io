description: An overview of the available sniproxy environment variables

sniproxy's behaviour is controlled by a variety of environment variables. They are detailed here along with the default values.

## Changing Environment Variables

<div class="note info">
  <h5>Recreating is ok</h5>
   <p>
Changing environment variables in docker requires you to delete and recreate your containers. Don't worry, your cache data is safely stored OUTSIDE in a volume and will be reused by the new containers
   </p>
</div>

If you are using `docker compose` these variables can be changed by editing the `.env` file provided. If a specific variable does not exist in your version of the `.env` just add a new line.

If you are using docker from the command line environment variables are specified using `-e VARIABLE=VALUE` format when you launch the container.
